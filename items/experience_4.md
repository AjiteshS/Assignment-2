My fourth experience was volunteering on the first year leadership program. This experience took place during September and May of 2024. I enjoyed this experience because it allowed me to meet new people on a campus where I didnt know too many people. My favourite memory is our sports event as I had a lot of fun. One part that I didnt enjoy were our late night meetings. I would give this experience a B.
